# To-do-app
This is a simple to-do list app I buit using HTML, CSS and (vanilla) Javascript to help me learn important programming concepts.

To open, simply clone the files to your computer and open the "main.html" file in your browser!

I will definitely return to it in the future and refactor and likely rebuild the entire thing once I'm more profficient!

Some additions for the future:-

- Better responsive design including media queries.
- Ability to save tasks/retain data even when the app is closed or reloaded.
- Tidying up the CSS. It's a total mess right now!
- And more!

Feel free to use my app for your own learning! If you're also just getting into programming like me, I really recommend you also have a go at building your own to-do app! You'll learn so much!
